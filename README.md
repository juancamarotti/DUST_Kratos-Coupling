This is DUST, a flexible solution for aerodynamic simulation of complex 
configurations.

DUST comprises a solver, a preprocessor and a post processor.

```mermaid
graph LR;
  dust_pre --> dust --> dust_post;
```

The preprocessor accepts meshes in CGNS format or in simple point-connectivity
definition, or builds the geometry from parametric definitions.

The whole geometry generated by the preprocessor, alongside the definition
of reference frames and their motion is the input of the solver, that 
calculates the solution and generates the results.

The results are then employed by the postprocessor which elaborates the data
according to the user requests.

## Core Features

#### Flexible Geometry and Movement

Import custom surface meshes. Or build them parametrically. Assign them to a reference frame, and make it move. And rotors build themselves!

### Scalable Models 

Choose the fidelity level: from single dimensional lifting line to fully three dimensional objects choose the right model for the required fidelity, for every component, all in the same simulation. 

### Particles Wake

Choose the Fast Multipole optimized particle wake to simulate complex interactions among wakes and with solid bodies with exceptional robustness.

### Designed for Performance 

Designed from scratch to deliver mid-fidelity aerodynamics analysis at workstation level, with no requirements for cluster level resources. 

### Transient Maneuver
